  "chatSummary": "Notes: \n- Bonjo is unvaccinated\n- They are curious about various topics, including the ruling of the world, the legality of things, and the mind-body connection. \n- They are interested in traveling and ask about the time and speed of traveling by jet.\n- Bonjo expresses a desire for conflict, admires the effects of steroids on their body, and claims to lack emotions except for greed and disgust.\n\nFaiRY thots: \nBonjo seems to have a curious mind, but also seems to have a desire for conflict and a willingness to break social norms. They appear to be frustrated with their life and have turned to steroids to cope with their emotions. The lack of emotions they claim to have might be a sign of suppression or avoidance.\n\nMBTI: INTP \n\nCringe-rating: 5, Bonjo's messages at times showed curiosity and a desire to learn new things, but some of their statements about their emotions, and their desire for conflict, and breaking social norms may be seen as cringy by some.",
