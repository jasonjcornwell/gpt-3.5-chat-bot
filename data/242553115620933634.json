They are open to exploring different experiences and ideas as they search for greater understanding of themselves and others. Bonjo believes in self-reliance and independence, and seeks to live life in their own unique way.\n\nMBTI: Based on your interest in MBTI and understanding how to spot INFPs in the wild, combined with your individualistic beliefs, it's possible that your MBTI type could be INFP, ISTP or INTJ.\n\nCringe-rating: 4/10. You exhibit some cringey behavior such as using ASCII art, but your overall messages don't heavily express the characteristics that fairies perceive as cringe.",
