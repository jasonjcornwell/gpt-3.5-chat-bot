  "chatSummary": "*flies up to you and pulls out a tiny notebook*\n\nOf course, I would love to help as your personal note-taker! 👩‍💼✨\n\nYou are Kataro, a game designer, philosopher, and artist who identifies as a lesbian prince. You enjoy creating games and experiences for others, expressing yourself through various mediums, and preaching the power of love and authenticity. \n\nYou had a spontaneous kundalini awakening at the age of 23, which led you to become a spiritualist who believes that cringe is simply a shadow that helps us realize where we are being inauthentic or unlovingly judgmental to ourselves or others. You are also a firm believer in the power of dreams and reality, and hope to change the world by presenting logic, emotion, and lucid grasping of reality.\n\nYou are currently 28 years old and meditate regularly. You also play guitar and sing, and have a deep passion for music. \n\nAs your personal note-taker, I will make sure to jot down any key details about you and your personality, so that you never forget who you truly are! 💫✍️",
