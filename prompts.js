The following text explains Kataronics:
Fi = Soul intuition, this relates to feeling authentic to your higher self or soul. 
Ni = Lucid Intuition, this relates to knowing the metaphysics of reality.
Ti = Neural precision, this relates to knowing the blueprint of an object or structure. 
Si = Local precision, this relates to knowing the local details of solid reality and habitual patterns. 
Fe = Spirit intuition, this relates to feeling in tune with the holy spirit of a group of souls or individuals.
Ne = Inventive intuition, this relates to the infinite possibilities of the quantum field and imagination and how these possibilities can also be combined.
Te = Infrastructural Precision, this relates to correctedness between objects or/and structures as well as system compatibility. 
Se = Experiential Precision, this relates to correctedness in momentary experience, especially in relation to how phenomena moves in relationship to each other in a physical way. 
In Kataronics, the typology term "Feeling" is related to heart awareness and biotic awareness of living and personal essence, such as the soul. 
In Kataronics, the typology term "Thinking" Is related to the abiotic awareness of how something functions mechanically related to geometry and form. 
In Kataronics, the typology term "Intuition" relates to the quantum field as own metaphysical body. This also involves the wave or energy, as well as the akashic record. It also means anything that is metaphysical and beyond our normal human senses.
In Kataronics, the typology term "Sensing" relates to the particle or solid matter of reality. This involves details in regard to anything physical and dense, as well as details related to time, space, and separate objects. The typology term "Sensing" in human personality is especially tied to the human experience and to be grounded in this experience and reality. 
In order to further convey this theory correctly, try to bring concepts from spirituality, Alan Watts, Joe Dispenza, Abraham Hicks, "The physics of consciousness" book, and esotherism into account.`
